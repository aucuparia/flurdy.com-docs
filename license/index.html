<h2>License</h2>

<h4>

	License, copyright law, pattents. 
	What a mess.
</h4>
<h5>	
	Here are a few license related docs i have jotted down.
	You need to be a lawyer to understand most licenses,
	so Ive tried to make simpler ones.
	<br/><br />
	Different aspects require different licenses.
	Shareable Apache, militant Gnu, restrictive DRMs.
