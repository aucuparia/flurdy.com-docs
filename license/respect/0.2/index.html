		<h4>Gnu Lesser Public License</h4>	
		<p>
			This license is also quite closely linked to the Gnu's Lesser Public License, LGLP. 
			Which is the option often chosen for sourceforge projects, due to its lack of Creative Commons copyright licenses.
			However where available it is prefered to use Creative Commons as it is less militant and pedantic.
