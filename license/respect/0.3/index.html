	<h3>
		Underlaying license
	</h3>
	<p>	
		The work associated with this license should specify what is the underlaying license.
	</p>
	<p>
		If non are specified the default license is:<br />
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>
					<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.5/">
						Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License</a>					
				</b>	
					<br />Known as CC by-nc-nd
			</li>
		</ul>		
	</p>
	<p>		
		It is quite restrictive so most work use one of these licenses:
		<ul>	
			<li><b><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">
					Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License</a></b>
				( CC by-sa )	
			</li>
			<li><b><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">
					Creative Commons Attribution License</a></b>
				( CC by )	
			</li>
			<li><b><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/GPL/2.0/">
					Gnu General Public License</a></b>
				( GPL )	
			</li>
			<li><b><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/LGPL/2.1/">
					Gnu Lesser General Public License</a></b>
				( LGPL )	
			</li>
		</ul>		
	</p>
	<p>
		You must obey/abide/respect the underlaying license.		
	</p>
	<p>
		The Creative Commons licenses are flexible and simpler to read,
		but not open source and not designed for software.
		The Gnu ones are more 'free', but more pedantic and militant.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may refer to anything licensed with flurdy's license of respect,
		as only licensed by the underlaying license.
	</p>
	
	<a name="intro"></a>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>	
		The underlaying license will tell you how to behave legally.
	</p>
	<p>	
		This document will advice you on behaving ethically.
	</p>
	<p>
		The suggestions are meant to assist people in understanding 
		how the creator would like you to apply the license.
		And how you can assist others and the creator by respecting
		these suggestions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Those who respect these suggestions will be celebrated.
	</p>
	<p>
		Those who ignore these suggestions may be shunned,
		cursed a bit, or just responsible for a sigh.

					<h5>Downloadable package</h5>
					<p>
